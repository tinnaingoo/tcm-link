            To meet the Adobe Photoshop system requirements, you'll need an Intel Core i7-920 paired with 8GB of RAM. While you don't need a dedicated graphics card, a GeForce GTX 950 will give you just enough horsepower to slightly enhance performance. Don't forget to free up 4GB of space on your storage device, however.
